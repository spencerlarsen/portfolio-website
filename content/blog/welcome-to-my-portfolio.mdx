# Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm excited to share my new portfolio website with you! This site showcases my engineering projects, research work, and technical writing.

## Why I Built This

As an engineering professional, having a central place to showcase my work is essential. This portfolio serves multiple purposes:

- **Project Showcase**: Displaying my technical projects with detailed documentation
- **Research Hub**: Sharing academic work and publications
- **Technical Blog**: Writing about technologies, insights, and lessons learned
- **Professional Presence**: A professional landing page for potential employers and collaborators

## Technology Stack

I chose a modern, performant tech stack that prioritizes developer experience and end-user performance:

### Next.js 14+

Next.js provides the perfect foundation for this portfolio with features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Optimal SEO and fast initial page loads
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-rendered pages for maximum performance
- **App Router**: Modern routing with layouts and server components
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization and lazy loading

### TypeScript

Type safety is crucial for maintainable code. TypeScript provides:

- Compile-time error catching
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through types
- Refactoring confidence

### Tailwind CSS

For styling, Tailwind CSS offers:

- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system
- No CSS bloat - only used classes are included
- Responsive design made simple

### MDX

MDX allows me to write blog posts in Markdown with JSX components:

```jsx
import { CustomComponent } from './components'

# My Blog Post

Regular markdown content here.

<CustomComponent prop="value" />

More markdown content.
```

This makes content creation flexible and powerful.

## Key Features

### 1. Responsive Design

The site works beautifully on all devices - mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. The navigation collapses into a mobile menu on smaller screens.

### 2. Fast Performance

With Next.js static generation and optimized assets, the site loads incredibly fast. Every page is pre-rendered at build time.

### 3. SEO Optimized

Proper metadata, Open Graph tags, and semantic HTML ensure the site is discoverable and looks great when shared on social media.

### 4. Modular Content Management

Projects and blog posts are easy to add - just create a new file in the `content` directory. No need to touch the code!

## Design Philosophy

I wanted a clean, minimalist aesthetic that puts the focus on content:

- **Generous whitespace**: Makes content easy to read
- **Subtle animations**: Polish without distraction  
- **Professional color scheme**: Blues and grays with accent colors
- **Clear hierarchy**: Typography that guides the reader

## What's Next

Future enhancements I'm considering:

- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Blog search functionality
- [ ] Project filtering and sorting
- [ ] RSS feed for blog posts
- [ ] Comments system
- [ ] Analytics integration

## Try It Yourself

This portfolio is open source! You can use it as a template for your own portfolio. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spencerlarsen/portfolio-website) for the code.

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio has been a great learning experience. I got to work with the latest web technologies and create something I'm proud to share.

If you have questions or feedback, feel free to [reach out](/contact)!
